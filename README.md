# MRK-2-textbook-code
The MRK-2 (Mini Robot Kit -2) brings significant upgrades mechanically and electronically, stretching the capabilities of an Arduino Uno-compatible board to the limits

This repository contains example code, exercise solutions,
and fully functional robot programs for the MRK-2 Sumo Robot
Kit and board.

Whenever possible, this repository attempts to logically group
each solution in the appropriate chapter's folder and with a
name that matches the exercise or solution.

Pull requests and code improvements are encouraged and may make
their way into future editions of the book.
