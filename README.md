# MRK-2-textbook-code
The MRK-2 (Mini Robot Kit -2) brings significant upgrades mechanically and electronically, stretching the capabilities of an Arduino Uno-compatible board to the limits

This repository contains example code, exercise solutions,
and fully functional robot programs for the MRK-2 Sumo Robot
Kit and board.  It is an update of the MRK-1 repository 
created by Eric Ryan Harrison.  Editing to make necessary pin 
changes and an occosional improvement to the code functionality 
was accomplished by William J. Ashby

Whenever possible, this repository attempts to logically group
each solution in the appropriate chapter's folder and with a
name that matches the exercise or solution.

Pull requests and code improvements are encouraged and may make
their way into future editions of the textbook.
